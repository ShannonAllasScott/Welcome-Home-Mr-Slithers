# Welcome Home, Mr Slithers

Author: Shannon Allas-Scott

A short (-ish) adventure (-ish) game (-ish). A snake-man returns from a spiritual journey to find his city in ruins. Guided by the spirit of wisdom, Mr Slithers’ search for survivors begins as his search for purpose ends.

Made using Adam Le Doux’s Bitsy Game Maker, plus Sean LeBlanc’s ‘transparent sprites’ and David Mowatt’s ‘bitsymuse'.

Though it’s hard to pin down an intended audience for this game, I can say it would likely have more resonance the more experience the player has with adventure games, the fantasy genre, or both. Fans of BioShock in particular may recognise similar themes such as the illusion of control and the player character’s purpose, whereas fans of stories that deal with ‘chosen one’ prophecies (eg. Harry Potter, The Legend of Zelda) may be more interested in Welcome Home, Mr Slithers’ inverted role of the Chosen One.

This game has a puzzle at around the midpoint, behind which the third act of the story is locked. If you wish to make it easier to get to the final and arguably most important part of the story, I have included hints (and eventually the solution) for this puzzle at the bottom of the GitHub README.

TEMPLE PUZZLE HINTS BELOW

If Sshaedh doesn't recall a Snakefolk prophecy, it's probably not a Snakefolk prophecy.

Eight statues. Eight candles.

Roman numerals are fun.

SOLUTION

The Sunscales' regnal numbers indicate the order the candles must be activated in, starting with Seliphus I and ending with Ewan VIII.
